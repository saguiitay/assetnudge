      "solution": "Show 6-10 images: hero shots, close-ups, real in-engine views, and a simple infographic of what's included."

      "mistake": "Missing or irrelevant tags",

    {
      "mistake": "Outdated listing with no recent updates",
      "impact": "Signals poor maintenance and may break on newer Unity versions/pipelines.",
      "solution": "Ship a small update (URP/HDRP notes, demo scene refresh) and highlight the new support in the changelog."
