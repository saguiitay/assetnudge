      "mistake": "No or weak tagging",
      "impact": "Reduced discoverability in search and browse filters.",

      "mistake": "Stale or unmaintained listing",

    {
      "mistake": "Misaligned pricing",
      "impact": "Overpriced items stall; free items without a roadmap fail to convert to paid.",

    {
      "mistake": "Vague titles",
      "impact": "Hard to compare against similar packs; lower click‑through.",
