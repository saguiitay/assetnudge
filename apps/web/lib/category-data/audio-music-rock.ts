    {
      "mistake": "Too few or generic preview images",

      "solution": "Show 6–10 images: hero shots, close-ups, real in-engine views, and a simple infographic of what’s included."

    {
      "mistake": "Missing or irrelevant tags",
      "impact": "Search and category filters won’t surface your asset to the right audience.",

    {
      "mistake": "Outdated listing with no recent updates",

      "mistake": "Underpricing that undermines quality",
      "impact": "Very low prices can imply low quality and reduce trust.",
      "solution": "Price fairly for the content and include a free lite sample instead of discounting the main pack."
